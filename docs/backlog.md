# Engineering Backlog

This backlog collects cross-cutting or future action items that emerge from reviews and planning.

Routing guidance:

- Use this file for non-urgent optimizations, refactors, or follow-ups that span multiple stories/epics.
- Must-fix items to ship a story belong in that story’s `Tasks / Subtasks`.
- Same-epic improvements may also be captured under the epic Tech Spec `Post-Review Follow-ups` section.

| Date | Story | Epic | Type | Severity | Owner | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 2025-11-07 | 1.2 | 1 | Bug | High | TBD | Open | Implement Clerk JWT signature verification in `src/lib/auth.ts` to satisfy AC-1.2.6 and secure `/api/companion/*` routing. |

Human notes:

- Make the dual memory visible and controllable as a card.
