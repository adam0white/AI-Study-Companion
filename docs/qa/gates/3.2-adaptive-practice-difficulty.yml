  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Performance tracking data properly isolated by student_id. No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient difficulty adjustment using last 2 answers only. Mastery calculation uses weighted average (70/30) to prevent drastic changes. D1 queries optimized with LIMIT clauses."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling in submitAnswer and completePractice. Difficulty bounds enforced (1-5). Graceful handling of missing subject_knowledge records."
