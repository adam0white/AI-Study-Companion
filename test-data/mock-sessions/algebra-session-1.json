      "speaker": "student",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "tutor",
      "text": "That's a great question! The quadratic formula works for any quadratic equation, but factoring is usually faster when the numbers work out nicely. Let me show you. Consider the equation x² + 5x + 6 = 0. Can you try factoring this?",
      "timestamp": "00:00:45"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "student",
      "text": "I think it factors to (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0?",
      "timestamp": "00:01:15"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "tutor",
      "text": "Excellent! That's exactly right. So the solutions are x = -2 and x = -3. Now let's try one that doesn't factor as easily: x² + 3x + 1 = 0. This one won't factor with integers, so we need the quadratic formula.",
      "timestamp": "00:01:30"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "student",
      "text": "Okay, so the quadratic formula is x equals negative b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, all over 2a, right?",
      "timestamp": "00:02:00"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "tutor",
      "text": "Perfect! You've got the formula. Now let's identify a, b, and c from our equation. In x² + 3x + 1 = 0, what are they?",
      "timestamp": "00:02:15"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "student",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "tutor",
      "text": "Correct! Now plug those into the formula and calculate.",
      "timestamp": "00:02:30"
    },
    {
      "speaker": "student",
      "text": "So it's x = (-3 ± √(9 - 4)) / 2 = (-3 ± √5) / 2",

      "speaker": "tutor",

      "speaker": "tutor",
      "text": "Great! For homework, practice these five problems using both factoring and the quadratic formula where applicable. We'll review them next session.",
